# AWS CloudFormation Scripts

CloudFormation scripts are a "1-click" deployment for complex topologies. These scripts use the executors' AWS account.

## Template YAML Files

The template yaml files in this directory must be copied to the Percona-Training S3 bucket in order to be usable by the CF system.
